# Keyboard and Mouse Reference

Every control in one place. "Viewport focus" means you have clicked in the 3D view since you last used another panel; the other shortcuts work whichever panel has focus (a text field you are typing in keeps its own keys).

## Mouse in the viewport

| Gesture | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Left-drag | on a joint | Full-body IK: the point you grabbed follows the cursor, the body follows anatomically. |
| Left-drag | on a finger or a toe | That digit alone bends toward the cursor; the hand, the foot and the body stay (with or without Ctrl). |
| Left-drag | on empty space or a model's body | Orbit the camera. |
| Ctrl + left-drag | on a limb or the head | Scoped IK: only the chain the joint belongs to follows — a limb up to the body, the head and neck. Nothing else moves. |
| Ctrl + left-drag | on the body (hips, belly, chest) | Moves the whole figure as she is posed: nothing is anchored to the floor, no joint turns. Pinned joints stay where they are pinned. |
| Left-click | on a model | Select it (blue outline); on empty space, deselect. |
| Left-click | on a joint | Select the joint (and make its figure the active one). A click on the face selects the head. |
| Middle-drag | anywhere | Pan. |
| Wheel | normally | Zoom. |
| Wheel | during a left-drag of a joint | Move the grabbed point toward (scroll down) or away from (scroll up) the camera. |
| Wheel | while holding `X`, `Y` or `Z` with a joint selected | Rotate the joint about that axis, 5° a notch. |
| Right-click | on a model or joint | The context menu: pin / unpin, reset joint or limb, mirror limb, delete. |

## Camera

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `1` / `Ctrl+1` | Front / Back view |
| `3` / `Ctrl+3` | Right / Left view |
| `7` / `Ctrl+7` | Top / Bottom view |
| `9` | Flip the view 180° |
| `5` | Home view (the default framing) |
| `.` | Frame the selected model |

The keys work on the number row and on the numeric keypad. With NumLock off, the keypad's `End` / `PageDown` / `Home` / `PageUp` / `Clear` (5) / `Del` stand in for `1` / `3` / `7` / `9` / `5` / `.`. The axis views are orthographic; orbiting returns to perspective.

## Posing

| Key | Needs | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `P` | viewport focus, a joint selected | Pin or unpin the selected joint |
| `B` | a joint selected | Bend the joint with the mouse: move to turn it, click to keep |
| `S` | a joint selected | The same for Side-Side |
| `T` | a joint selected | The same for Twist |
| Left click or `Enter` | while `B` / `S` / `T` is on | Keep the result |
| `Esc`, right click, or the same key again | while `B` / `S` / `T` is on | Put the joint back as it was |
| `Delete` or `Backspace` | viewport focus, a model selected | Delete the selected model (clears the undo history) |
| `Ctrl+Z` | | Undo |
| `Ctrl+Y` | | Redo |

`B`, `S` and `T` work whichever panel has the keyboard focus (they are the keys of **Edit → Turn Joint with Mouse**); `P` and `Delete` need the viewport to have it. Edit → Reset Selected Joint, Reset Limb, Reset Pose, Mirror Pose and Mirror Limb to Other Side have no keys; they are on the Edit menu and (the per-joint ones) on the joint's context menu.
