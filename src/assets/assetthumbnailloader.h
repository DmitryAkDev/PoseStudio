/**
 * @file assetthumbnailloader.h
 * @brief Off-thread thumbnail decoding for the asset grid, plus the shared thumbnail canvas.
 *
 * A folder can hold hundreds of assets, each with a preview image of arbitrary size. Decoding
 * them on the GUI thread, even 20 per event-loop tick as the widget once did, stalled the grid
 * and forced a full relayout per batch. This loader decodes on QtConcurrent's global pool
 * (QImageReader is reentrant, QImage is a value type), asking the codec to decode straight to
 * thumbnail size (JPEG can do 1/2..1/8 DCT scaling), paints the gradient canvas on the worker
 * as a QImage, and only turns the result into a QPixmap/QIcon on the GUI thread, where the
 * item's setIcon repaints just that cell.
 *
 * Jobs are keyed by grid ITEM POINTER plus a generation counter: clear() bumps the generation
 * (and must be called before the grid is cleared), so a result for an item that has since been
 * deleted is dropped without ever touching the pointer. Item pointers rather than row indices
 * because a drag-reorder while thumbnails are still loading shifts rows, but QListWidget's
 * takeItem/insertItem never invalidates the pointers. Workers read the generation through a
 * shared atomic so a stale job skips the decode entirely instead of wasting the pool.
 *
 * Every canvas is a THUMB-sized SQUARE rendered at the grid's device pixel ratio, with the
 * ratio set on the pixmap: the old 120x128 canvas was always drawn into a 120x120 icon rect,
 * so QIcon downscaled every thumbnail to 112x120 (a narrower gradient box, a second resample),
 * and without a device pixel ratio a 1.5x display showed 120 device pixels upscaled to 180.
