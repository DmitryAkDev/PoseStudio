/**
 * @file assetfolderproxymodel.h
 * @brief The identity proxy between the Asset Manager's QStandardItemModel tree and its view:
 *        folder "hit" classification (icons + greyed text) and collection drag-reparenting.
 *
 * The tree's source model is a plain QStandardItemModel of physical folders and virtual rows.
 * This proxy overlays two things on it without touching the source.
 *
 * (1) Hit state. Each folder row's icon and text colour reflect whether the folder contains
 * assets DIRECTLY (AssetScan's non-image-plus-same-basename-image rule), only somewhere BELOW
 * it (IndirectHit), or nowhere (NoHit, greyed); a Collection counts as a hit when it holds at
 * least one item that still exists on disk. Classifying a folder means walking its subtree,
 * and data() runs for every visible row on every repaint, so nothing is ever classified inline:
 * an unknown row is queued, painted with a placeholder icon, classified on a QtConcurrent
 * worker (AssetScan::classifyFolder is a pure function of the filesystem; a collection check
 * stats its item paths from one aggregate query), and re-painted once its state lands. Results
 * are merged into a per-path cache on the GUI thread only; the cache and queue reset with the
 * model, and a generation counter discards results from before a reset. The search needs
 * states synchronously (it walks results as it finds them): folderHitState() classifies on
 * the calling thread into the same cache.
 *
 * (2) Drag-and-drop. Only Collection rows are draggable and only Collections/the Collections
 * header accept drops; a validated drop is reported through collectionReparentRequested, and
 * AssetManagerWidget performs the DB update and the tree-node move itself (the model stays
 * read-mostly).
