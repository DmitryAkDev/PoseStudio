/**
 * @file assetbreadcrumblabel.h
 * @brief The title above the asset grid: a clickable breadcrumb for physical folders, a plain
 *        name for virtual sources (Favorites, Collections).
 *
 * For a physical folder the label resolves which library root the folder lives under and
 * renders "Library / a / b / current" as rich text where every ancestor is a real link
 * (clicking navigates there) and the current folder is bright and inert. The structure
 * (library root + name, segments, each segment's full path) is resolved ONCE in setFolder and
 * cached; a resize only re-lays it out, fitting as many TRAILING segments as the width allows
 * and collapsing the rest into a non-clickable "...". Hovering a link underlines it (the
 * label re-renders its HTML on linkHovered). Right-clicking offers Open/Browse for the hovered
 * ancestor (or the current folder), suppressing Qt's built-in "Copy Link" menu; virtual titles
 * get no menu. The label emits requests rather than acting: the owner decides what "navigate"
 * means (deselecting the tree, displaying the folder).
