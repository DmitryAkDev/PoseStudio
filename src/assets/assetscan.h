/**
 * @file assetscan.h
 * @brief Filesystem scanning for the Asset Manager: what counts as an asset, how folders are
 *        classified, how paths are compared. QtCore only, no widgets, no database.
 *
 * The one rule everything here implements: an ASSET is a non-image file (sidecar extensions
 * such as .mtl excluded) that shares its basename with an image file in the same folder; that
 * image is the asset's thumbnail, and when several qualify the LARGEST wins. A folder that
 * holds such a pair is a DirectHit, one that only has a DirectHit somewhere below it is an
 * IndirectHit, and anything else is NoHit (greyed in the tree). Every scan site in the module
 * (tree lazy-load, grid subfolders, search, hit classification) goes through the filters and
 * helpers below so the symlink and case policies are decided exactly once:
 *
 * - Symlinked/junctioned directories are NEVER followed (kSubdirFilter carries NoSymLinks).
 *   The recursive walkers have no cycle protection (QDirIterator doesn't either), and before
 *   this header the tree included such folders while the grid/search/hit walk excluded them,
 *   so a junction showed in the tree but never as a grid folder and painted its parent "empty".
 * - Paths compare CASE-INSENSITIVELY everywhere (kPathCase). Stored library paths and scanned
 *   paths come from the same QDir/QFileDialog sources, so the only way they differ by case is
 *   the user retyping one; a case-sensitive compare then silently broke breadcrumbs and
 *   "Find In Library" on Windows, where the filesystem itself is case-insensitive.
 *
 * The classification (classifyFolder) is a pure function of the filesystem so the proxy model
 * can run it on a worker thread; it never touches Qt GUI types.
