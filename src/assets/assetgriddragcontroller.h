/**
 * @file assetgriddragcontroller.h
 * @brief The hand-rolled asset drag out of the thumbnail grid: reorder within a sortable view,
 *        or drop onto a Collection/Favorites tree node.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT Qt's QDrag/InternalMove: in IconMode, QListWidget's internal move
 * free-positions the icon instead of reordering rows, and QDrag runs through the OS drag loop.
 * The controller tracks raw mouse events from the grid viewport (AssetManagerWidget's event
 * filter forwards them to handleMouseEvent), floats a translucent ghost QLabel of the thumbnail
 * under the cursor, shows a between-items drop-line while the cursor is inside a SORTABLE grid
 * (Favorites/Collection), or lights the Collection/Favorites tree node under the cursor once it
 * leaves the grid, and auto-scrolls via a QTimer when the cursor sits in the top/bottom edge
 * zone. The grid is left untouched until release (moving items mid-drag would reflow the
 * layout under the cursor); on release it either reorders the rows and asks the owner to
 * persist the order, or hands the item + target node to the owner. The kGridDraggingProperty
 * flag tells AssetGridDelegate to suppress the hover highlight while a drag is live.
 *
 * Any button press while a drag is live cancels it first. Windows opens the context menu on
 * the right button's RELEASE, so a right-click mid-drag used to leave the drag stuck: the
 * left release was swallowed by the menu's grab, the (unparented, top-level) ghost stayed on
 * screen for the session and the grid never hover-highlighted again.
