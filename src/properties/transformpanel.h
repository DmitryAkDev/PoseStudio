/**
 * @file transformpanel.h
 * @brief The "Transform" properties tab: the selected joint's rotation as three dials.
 *
 * A self-contained docker panel (its own module, like EnvironmentPanel): with a joint selected on
 * the posable figure it shows that joint's name and three DragNumberBox rows —
 *
 *   Bend       the joint's natural direction (a knee's fold, a spine joint's forward bend)
 *   Side-Side  its secondary direction
 *   Twist      the turn about its own length
 *
 * — each on the same scale: 0 is the rest pose, 100 is the joint's limit in that direction, and a
 * negative value bends it the other way in the same proportion until the other limit stops it (a
 * knee reads -7..100). Which Euler channel each dial turns, its scale and its range are the
 * armature's business (Armature::jointDial); the panel only mirrors what the viewport reports
 * (ViewportWidget::jointTransform) and sends the values the user sets. A row whose motion the
 * joint does not have (a locked channel — an elbow has no side bend) is disabled.
 *
 * Live both ways: a dial scrub poses the figure as it moves (an FK rotation through the joint
 * limits and the collision stop — the row shows where the pose actually rests), and the rows
 * follow the figure whenever the pose or the selection changes by any other means — an IK drag,
 * the viewport's B / S / T mouse mode (which turns these same dials), undo, a pose load
 * (ViewportWidget::jointTransformChanged).
 *
 * Undo: every completed gesture (a scrub, a type-in, a row's restore button, Reset All) is
 * ONE entry on the viewport's unified undo stack, bracketed begin/endJointTransformEdit.
