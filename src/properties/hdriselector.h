/**
 * @file hdriselector.h
 * @brief The Environment tab's HDRI picker: a button that drops a scrollable thumbnail menu of
 *        every panorama in the user library's hdri/ tree.
 *
 * Split out of EnvironmentPanel so the panel stays a list of lighting dials and this widget owns
 * everything about choosing an environment file: the menu that is rebuilt on every open (files
 * the user adds/removes/refiles while the app runs show up immediately), the per-subfolder
 * category headings, the thumbnail decode cache, and the "which file is current" state.
 *
 * It is the app's button + QMenu picker pattern (see menupickerbutton.h for why not QComboBox),
 * but the menu's content is a QWidgetAction hosting a QListWidget (#HdriList) rather than plain
 * actions: a bare QMenu can neither cap itself at N rows nor show a real scroll bar. All of its
 * styling lives in _environment.qss under the object names set here (#EnvironmentHdriButton,
 * #HdriList, #HdriFolderLink, #HdriEmptyLabel); the category headings are painted by a delegate
 * in the .cpp because QSS cannot address individual list items.
 *
 * The widget IS the button (a QPushButton subclass) so the form row that hosts it, and the QSS
 * ID selector that styles it, see exactly the widget they always did.
