/**
 * @file environmentpanel.h
 * @brief The "Environment" properties tab: live controls for the viewport's image-based lighting.
 *
 * A self-contained docker panel (its own module, like AssetManagerWidget and the Preferences
 * panels) that drives the viewport's lighting: the HDRI environment (through HdriSelector), the
 * backdrop drawn behind the figure (mode / blur / brightness / dome radius), exposure and the
 * tonemap toggle, the IBL diffuse/specular levels, an ambient fill, the key light (intensity +
 * aim) and its shadows (enable / intensity / softness / reach), the skin and rim accents, and the
 * environment rotation. Every control except the HDRI selector is a live shader dial (no IBL
 * re-bake), so tweaking is instant — the point being to dial in the values that will become the
 * defaults. It talks to the viewport through the ViewportWidget facade; it owns no Vulkan state.
 *
 * Undo: every completed edit gesture (a scrub or type-in, a per-row restore button, a toggle, the
 * backdrop-mode pick, restore-all) is ONE entry on the viewport's unified undo stack. The panel
 * brackets each gesture with beginSettingsEdit/commitSettingsEdit — depth-counted, so composite
 * gestures fold into one entry — and registers the pre-edit LightingSettings; an undo/redo that
 * lands renderer-side comes back through ViewportWidget::lightingRestored and is mirrored into
 * the widgets with their signals blocked. HDRI switches are deliberately NOT on the stack (a
 * switch is a re-bake, not a cheap state re-apply).
 *
 * The dials are TABLE-DRIVEN: addValueRow / addToggleRow bind a widget to one LightingSettings
 * member and record the pair, and the live push, the per-row restore, restore-all and the
 * restored-state sync all iterate those records — adding a dial is one addValueRow line.
