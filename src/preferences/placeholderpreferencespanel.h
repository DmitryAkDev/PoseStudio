/**
 * @file placeholderpreferencespanel.h
 * @brief A Preferences page that exists only to hold its tab's place until the real page is built.
 *
 * Several tabs (Interface, Input, Navigation, System) are planned but have no settings yet. One
 * parameterized class registers all of them instead of a subclass file per empty page — their
 * whole behaviour is a title and a muted "will appear here" line. See preferencespanel.h for how
 * to promote one of these into a real page.
