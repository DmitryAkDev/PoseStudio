/**
 * @file constants.h
 * @brief Cross-cutting compile-time constants: app identity, preference keys, shared UI
 *        geometry/colours/timings.
 *
 * Anything two or more subsystems agree on lives here rather than as duplicated magic numbers
 * (e.g. the grid delegates' cell geometry, the one separator grey every divider uses). Viewport-
 * internal tuning that nothing outside src/viewport/ needs stays next to its use; promote a value
 * here only once a second subsystem depends on it.
