/**
 * @file followeraddons.h
 * @brief Post-load follower addons: finding a preset's declared followers, fitting them to the
 *        character's morphed shape, and merging them into the parent figure.
 *
 * A character preset can declare follower figures to be loaded after it — a whole figure
 * generation attaches its eyelashes this way, and stylized characters ship replacement anatomy
 * (cartoon eyeballs, brows, lashes) for the standard surfaces their preset hides. Each addon is a
 * self-describing wearable figure that figureimporter loads through its own pipeline; this module
 * owns everything around that: reading the post-load block (findPostLoadAddons), the shape-follow
 * projection that keeps a base-authored follower on the morphed surface (buildAddonProjection +
 * followParentShape), and the merge into the parent's mesh list / skeleton / base-vertex space
 * (mergeAddonFigure). The fit model has three load-bearing rules, each learned from real content
 * and documented at the function that implements it: ordinary followers are projected by the
 * nearest visible parent cage vertex's morph delta; a POPULATED graft marks a vendor-fitted
 * replacement that must NOT be projected (and never re-fit by snapping to parent joints); and
 * projection deltas come only from VISIBLE zones. Pure std + GLM + nlohmann — no Qt, no Vulkan.
