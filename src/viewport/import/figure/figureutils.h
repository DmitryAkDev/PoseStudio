/**
 * @file figureutils.h
 * @brief Shared JSON / URI / path helpers for the native figure importer (import/figure/).
 *
 * Every parser in this folder walks the same few conventions of the scene format — array blocks
 * written as {"count":N,"values":[...]} or bare, channel objects carrying a dialed `current_value`
 * over a default `value`, channel references of the form "[Scope:][file]#id[?property]", and the
 * geometry/modifier library lookups — and each used to carry a private copy (five valuesArray()s,
 * two percent-decoders, three channel-reference splitters that agreed on real content and differed
 * on corner cases). They live here ONCE so a fix lands everywhere and the parsers read the same
 * way. Two things a newcomer must not "fix":
 *
 *  - The channel readers come in TWO deliberate flavours, documented side by side below: the
 *    "current wins" readers (channelScalar/channelDouble/channelBool/channelColor) for DIALED values
 *    — a material colour, a morph weight — and the "rest wins" reader (restVec3Channels) for BIND
 *    transforms, where a scene's current_value is the posed state and the bind must come from rest.
 *  - parseChannelRef() returns BOTH the raw and the percent-decoded id: the morph resolver compares
 *    raw-vs-raw (both sides come from the same encoded formula text), while the corrective gate
 *    path compares the decoded id against dialed morph ids (which arrive decoded). Each caller
 *    picks the field it always compared on, so consolidation changed no behaviour.
 *
 * Pure std + GLM + nlohmann — no Qt, no Vulkan.
