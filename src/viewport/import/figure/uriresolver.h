/**
 * @file uriresolver.h
 * @brief Resolves the cross-file asset references used by the native figure scene format.
 *
 * A figure is spread across many files: a character preset (.duf) references a base figure (.dsf),
 * which references a UV set (.dsf), morphs (.dsf), etc. References are URIs like
 *   "/data/Vendor/FigureBase/basefigure.dsf#geometry"
 * — a URL-encoded, root-relative file path plus a "#fragment" naming an asset inside that file.
 * This resolver turns a URI into an on-disk path (searching the configured content roots),
 * URL-decodes it, and caches the parsed documents it loads so a shared base file isn't re-read and
 * re-inflated for every reference into it.
 *
 * Resolution order (see resolve()): the EXACT-case path is tried under every root first, and only
 * then does each root get the case-tolerant component walk. The tolerant walk exists for the
 * case-sensitive filesystems (Linux/macOS) where the URIs' mixed case ("one One" vs the on-disk
 * "ONE One") would miss; on NTFS the exact probe already absorbs case, so the walk never runs there.
 * Trying all roots exactly first matters with two or more roots: a file that lives under root[1]
 * used to pay a directory walk of root[0] on every reference. The walk's per-directory listings
 * are memoized on the resolver, which is why resolve() is const but NOT thread-safe — like the
 * document cache, call it from one thread (the parallel prefetch keeps its workers off both).
 * Pure std (+ FigureDocument) — no Qt, no Vulkan.
