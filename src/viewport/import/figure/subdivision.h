/**
 * @file subdivision.h
 * @brief Catmull-Clark subdivision of a figure cage into the assembled per-zone render meshes.
 *
 * The base figure is authored as a low-resolution quad *cage* meant to be subdivided at render time;
 * drawn directly it looks faceted on curved areas (limbs, face). This subdivides the cage @p levels
 * times: positions follow the smooth Catmull-Clark rules, while UVs (per polygon corner, so seams are
 * preserved) and skin weights are refined linearly. It then assembles the result into per-zone render
 * meshes — triangulated, de-indexed at UV seams, smooth-normalled over the whole surface so zone
 * boundaries stay seamless. Level 0 runs the same assembly on the raw cage, so this is THE assembler
 * for every level and the engine, skinning, and pose correctives see one vertex layout.
 *
 * The key property this leans on: Catmull-Clark is a *linear* operator on per-vertex values, so the
 * same stencils that smooth the rest positions also carry any per-base-vertex displacement field onto
 * the subdivided cage. carryCorrectivesToSubdivided() uses the retained per-level topology to rewrite
 * each pose corrective's sparse cage deltas onto the subdivided cage once at import, so the GPU's
 * live corrective blend (weight · delta summed before skinning, see mesh.vert) drives the dense mesh
 * directly.
 *
 * Pure std + GLM (+ the figure IR) — no Qt, no Vulkan.
