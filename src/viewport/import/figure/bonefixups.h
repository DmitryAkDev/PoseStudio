/**
 * @file bonefixups.h
 * @brief Post-parse adjustments to a figure's skeleton: morph-driven joint centres and the legacy
 *        twist-bone bend lock.
 *
 * nodeparser lifts the skeleton exactly as the base file authors it. Two things then have to be
 * corrected before the rig is handed to skinning, and both belong to the figure pipeline rather
 * than the parser: (1) the character's identity morphs also drive each bone's rest centre (a
 * FBM/FHM morph carries hundreds of `center_point` formulas), so the rig must move with the
 * morphed proportions — a base-figure rig around a morphed mesh pivots limbs at the wrong places
 * and the joint overlay floats off the body; and (2) old figure generations that predate the
 * format's per-channel `locked` flag leave a mid-limb twist bone free to BEND, which the geometric
 * fallback here forbids (the runtime's clampBoneEuler then enforces the lock on every posing path).
 * Order matters: apply the centre offsets first, so the lock's length direction reflects the
 * character's proportions. Pure std + GLM — no Qt, no Vulkan.
