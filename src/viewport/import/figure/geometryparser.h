/**
 * @file geometryparser.h
 * @brief Parses a figure geometry definition (the base cage) into the importer's GeometryData.
 *
 * The figure format stores geometry as a shared vertex pool plus a polygon list of quads/tris, each
 * tagged with a material-zone index. parseGeometry() lifts that into a GeometryData — the cage the
 * rest of the pipeline morphs, skins, subdivides and assembles (subdivision.h does the
 * triangulation / seam split / smooth normals for every level, including level 0). Each face
 * remembers its index in the SOURCE polylist: the UV set's seam overrides are keyed by that index,
 * and a polygon skipped as degenerate must not shift every later face's key. Pure std + GLM +
 * nlohmann — no Qt.
