/**
 * @file skinparser.h
 * @brief Parses a figure's skin binding into per-vertex joint weights for GPU (dual-quaternion)
 *        skinning.
 *
 * The base figure carries a "skin binding" modifier: a list of joints, each naming a bone and the
 * sparse (vertex, weight) pairs it influences. This inverts that into one entry per base vertex —
 * its top-4 influencing bones (as indices) with normalized weights, the form the GPU skinning
 * shader consumes (it blends the joints' dual quaternions by these weights; the figure format
 * authors its weights against dual quaternions, so no re-weighting happens here).
 * Pure std + GLM + nlohmann — no Qt.
