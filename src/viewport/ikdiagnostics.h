/**
 * @file ikdiagnostics.h
 * @brief IK drag-loop diagnostics (POSESTUDIO_IK_PERF=1) and the state of the scripted IK
 *        benchmark (POSESTUDIO_IK_BENCH=<bone>[:depth]).
 *
 * This exists so the 60 Hz drag tick and the frame loop test ONE pointer — VulkanWindow::m_diag,
 * null unless one of those environment variables is set — instead of a scatter of perf/bench
 * members and flags on the window. The measurements, the benchmark's bookkeeping, and the
 * report live here; the DRIVING logic (startBench / benchAdvance / benchDepthNotch /
 * benchFinish, in vulkanwindow_bench.cpp) stays on VulkanWindow because it moves the drag
 * target and reads the camera.
 *
 * The benchmark is the in-app parity reference for the IK harness (tools/ikharness): the report
 * format, the phases at which it prints, and what each statistic counts must not change.
