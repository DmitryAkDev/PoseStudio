// correctives.glsl — the per-model pose-corrective (JCM) buffers and their per-vertex blend.
//
// Pose correctives are blended BEFORE skinning: each vertex carries a packed range into the
// model's corrective-delta buffer (binding 2 — entries sorted per vertex), and the per-frame
// corrective weights (binding 1) scale those deltas. The corrected bind mesh is then skinned,
// exactly what the CPU re-morph used to produce — but a weight change is now a tiny per-frame
// buffer write instead of a device-idle + vertex-buffer re-upload, which is what lets the
// correctives track a drag live rather than popping in on release.
//
// Shared by mesh.vert and shadow.vert (the shadow and the outline must trace the corrected
// surface) — both bind the buffers at SKIN_SET, defined by the including shader (see skinning.glsl).
