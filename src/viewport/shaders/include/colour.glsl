// Included by mesh.frag (the matcap mode tonemaps inline; the selection highlight) and
// composite.frag (the PBR chain's final ACES step). The stylized modes author display-ready
// values and never tonemap.

// ACES filmic tonemap. Applied in composite.frag for the PBR family (which renders linear HDR into
// the offscreen target, so bloom thresholds/blurs see real radiance) and inline by the matcap
// mode, whose procedural material sphere exceeds 1.0 and writes straight to a display-ready
// value. The sRGB swapchain then does its own gamma encode.

// The viewport's selection accent: the app's QSS accent blue #5b87cc, sRGB-decoded to LINEAR (the
// swapchain's sRGB store re-encodes it exactly). The same value as kSelectionAccentLinear in
// rendering/postprocess.h, which pushes it to the composite for the selection outline — change
// both together.
