#version 450

// HDRI backdrop fragment stage: samples the lighting environment along the per-pixel eye ray, so
// the panorama that lights the figure is also VISIBLE behind it — reflections and shading read as
// coming from somewhere real, and the figure sits in a place instead of a void. Follows the same
// exposure / rotation dials as the PBR shading (mesh.frag), so backdrop and subject always agree;
// like the PBR mode it writes LINEAR HDR and leaves the tonemapping to the composite.
//
// The sampled image is the prefiltered specular cubemap's lower mips (set 3 binding 0 — bound
// here as set 1): mip 0 is the environment itself. The panel's Blur dial selects the LOD —
// photographic background defocus, which also hides the cube's finite resolution.
//
// Pass:    the HDR scene pass, first draw (depth test/write off).
// Inputs:  set 0.0 the camera UBO (exposure, rotation, the backdrop dials); set 1.0 the
//          prefiltered environment cube (the scene's IBL set bound at index 1).
// Outputs: location 0 -> colour attachment 0 (linear HDR, alpha 0); attachment 1 masked.
