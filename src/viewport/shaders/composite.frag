#version 450

// The fullscreen composite: HDR scene + bloom, then ACES into the sRGB swapchain, then the
// selection outline over the top. In the PBR mode the scene passes arrive LINEAR (mesh/background
// no longer tonemap inline) — tonemapping lives here so bloom thresholds/blurs operate on real
// radiance. The stylized modes still author display-ready values, so they pass through untouched
// (tonemap + bloom both off).
//
// The selection outline is a UI element, not scene light: it is painted AFTER tonemapping so it
// keeps its exact theme colour whatever the exposure/tonemap dials do. uOutline is the selected
// object's coverage mask (OutlineMask, MSAA-resolved so its silhouette edge is fractional). The
// outline lives OUTSIDE the object: the mask is dilated by the outline width (the max over a ring
// of taps) and the outline weight is the excess of that dilation over the pixel's own coverage —
// zero inside the object, (1 − coverage) on its anti-aliased fringe (so outline and object blend
// exactly like the object blends with the background), full within the width, and softened by
// the mask's bilinear filtering along the outer edge.
//
// Pass:    the swapchain present pass (single-sample), the frame's only draw there.
// Inputs:  set 0.0 the (SSS-diffused) HDR resolve, 0.1 the bloom target, 0.2 the outline mask;
//          push: params (tonemap, bloom strength, bloom on, outline width px) + the outline colour.
// Outputs: location 0 -> the swapchain image (the sRGB store gamma-encodes).
