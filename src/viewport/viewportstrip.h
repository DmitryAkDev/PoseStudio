/**
 * @file viewportstrip.h
 * @brief The control strip floating in the viewport's top-right corner: the shading-mode and
 *        view pickers, the Home / Ground / Skeleton buttons, and the axis-rotate badge.
 *
 * The strip is a TOP-LEVEL window, not a child widget: the viewport is a native child window
 * (QWidget::createWindowContainer), which composites on top of every ordinary sibling widget,
 * so anything that must paint over it has to be its own window positioned over the container
 * in global coordinates (the SplashOverlay rule). It is `Qt::Tool | Qt::FramelessWindowHint`:
 * a plain Qt::Window is a full application window that X11/Wayland list in the taskbar and
 * stack wherever the WM pleases (the strip showed up as a second window BEHIND the main one on
 * Linux); a tool window stays out of the window list and is kept above its owner.
 *
 * The strip knows NOTHING about the Vulkan window: it only emits what the user picked and
 * accepts what state to show. ViewportWidget is the sole wiring point between the two, which
 * is also what keeps teardown safe — the strip can be deleted after the window without a
 * dangling connection firing into it.
