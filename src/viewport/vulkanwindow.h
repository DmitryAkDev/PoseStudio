/**
 * @file vulkanwindow.h
 * @brief The QWindow that owns the Vulkan surface and the renderer, and turns every viewport
 *        gesture — camera, posing, pins, undo — into calls on the Qt-free engine.
 *
 * This is the bridge between Qt's windowing/event world and the Qt-free rendering/ + scene/
 * subtrees: it creates the per-window VkSurfaceKHR (via the app's QVulkanInstance), stands up
 * the VulkanContext + VulkanRenderer once the platform surface exists, pumps one frame per
 * UpdateRequest, and owns every interaction state machine the viewport has. It is never
 * parented into the widget tree directly — ViewportWidget wraps it with
 * QWidget::createWindowContainer(). The Vulkan objects' lifetime is tied to the platform
 * surface: they are torn down on SurfaceAboutToBeDestroyed, before Qt frees the surface.
 *
 * ONE class, SEVEN translation units (the armatureik.cpp pattern): input, IK, pose/undo and the
 * camera all mutate the same private gesture flags and must all call requestUpdate(), so they
 * stay one class with this header as the single contract, split by concern:
 *   - vulkanwindow.cpp             lifecycle: construction, Vulkan init/teardown/device loss,
 *                                  the remembered scene state and the import queue, expose /
 *                                  resize / the event-driven frame.
 *   - vulkanwindow_environment.cpp the HDRI: default path, the off-thread IBL bake, lighting dials.
 *   - vulkanwindow_input.cpp       mouse/wheel/key handlers — pure ROUTING into the gestures below,
 *                                  plus the object context menu and cursor→ray helpers.
 *   - vulkanwindow_camera.cpp      named views, the Blender-convention view hotkeys, projection.
 *   - vulkanwindow_ik.cpp          the full-body-IK drag loop (the 60 Hz tick, the release settle,
 *                                  wheel depth), the animated ground fall.
 *   - vulkanwindow_pose.cpp        pose edits as undo entries: commit, utilities, pins, save/load,
 *                                  delete, the Transform tab's dials and the joint mouse mode
 *                                  (B / S / T), the unified undo/redo stack.
 *   - vulkanwindow_bench.cpp       the POSESTUDIO_IK_PERF / POSESTUDIO_IK_BENCH diagnostics.
 * The private declarations below follow the same order.
 *
 * Gesture contracts (each learned from a real failure; see CLAUDE.md's viewport section):
 * rendering is EVENT-DRIVEN — every visual mutation calls requestUpdate(); camera drags gate on
 * m_activeDragButtons (buttons whose press was seen HERE), never on QMouseEvent::buttons(); a
 * plain left drag on a joint is the full-body-IK gesture and Ctrl+drag the single-joint FK
 * rotate; the 60 Hz drag timer is the SOLE IK solve driver (mouse moves only record the target);
 * a left press released within the platform drag distance is a CLICK (model select); a release
 * hands off to an ANIMATED settle, a ground drop to an animated fall, and every other pose edit
 * closes those first (closeOpenPoseEdits) while a button-held drag REFUSES them (dragInFlight).
