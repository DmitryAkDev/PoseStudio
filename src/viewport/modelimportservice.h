/**
 * @file modelimportservice.h
 * @brief The Qt-facing orchestration that turns a file path into a model in the scene.
 *
 * This is the seam between the Qt-free import/ subsystem and the Qt-free renderer core. It:
 *   1. picks the right importer for the file (ImporterRegistry),
 *   2. parses it into a format-neutral ModelData (MeshImporter::load),
 *   3. decodes each mesh's texture maps via QImage — from external paths OR embedded bytes — into
 *      tightly-packed shared RGBA8 images (all six material slots), baking opacity masks into the
 *      diffuse alpha and gutter-filling UV seams, so the renderer never needs an image codec,
 *   4. bakes per-vertex ambient occlusion + tangents on the final mesh, and
 *   5. uploads it (VulkanRenderer::addModel),
 * optionally driving a modal staged progress dialog through those phases.
 *
 * Steps 3-5 — everything after the format-specific parse — are the SAME for every source, so
 * they live here once (uploadModelData + the ImportProgress dialog/clock) and the figure path
 * (FigureImportService) calls them after its own parse: any new import path must go through
 * them too, or the decode-once texture sharing and the seam-killing gutter fill are lost.
 *
 * All the Qt (QImage decode, progress UI) lives here so both the importers and the renderer stay
 * Qt-free. VulkanWindow just forwards to it. Import runs synchronously on the GUI thread.

     * drain, called from inside the expose/init path where that pump could re-enter it), the
     * object still keeps the clock so the timing log is identical either way. The dialog closes
     * when done() reaches the maximum, or with the object on an exception path.
