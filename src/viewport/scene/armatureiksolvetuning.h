 *
 * The numbers are the model: weights per m^2 / rad^2, stiffness classes, the shares and ranges
 * every gesture is gated by. Each is annotated with what it was measured against (the IK harness
 * on the eight reference rigs, the character sweep, the in-app galleries) — change one, and the
 * comment says which phases will tell you what it cost. Private to the solve: only
 * armatureiksolve*.cpp and armatureikpost.cpp include it. Qt-free (std + GLM).
