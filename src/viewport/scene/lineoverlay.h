/**
 * @file lineoverlay.h
 * @brief The viewport's line overlays: the posing skeleton, the joint-pin markers, and the
 *        orthographic side views' floor line — one host-mapped line buffer, one draw.
 *
 * Everything drawn as lines over the scene goes through here, at the end of the main pass, so
 * the Scene records exactly one overlay draw per frame whatever is showing. The skeleton is
 * hidden by default — joints are grabbed directly on the figure, so the character isn't
 * cluttered with a bone cage — and picking never depends on it (bonepicker.h hit-tests the joints
 * regardless). The pin markers, by contrast, always show: a user pin persists across drags and
 * the user must see where it is. The floor line exists because an orthographic side view sees
 * the floor plane exactly edge-on, where the grid shader's ray/plane intersection has nothing to
 * hit. The overlay runs even with no models in the scene — that is what keeps the floor line on
 * screen in an empty viewport. Qt-free (Vulkan + std + GLM).
