/**
 * @file cameraubo.h
 * @brief The per-frame camera + lighting uniform block (descriptor set 0) and the code that
 *        fills it from the camera, the Environment panel's dials, and the baked environment.
 *
 * The block is the one contract between the CPU and every scene shader that reads set 0
 * (mesh.vert/frag, background.frag, skeleton.vert): its std140 layout must match the `CameraUbo`
 * declaration in those shaders field for field. Keeping the struct and its fill routine in one
 * Qt-free file means a new dial is added in exactly two places — here and the shader — and the
 * Scene just memcpy's the result into this frame's mapped buffer. The analytic 3-point rig
 * (key/fill/rim) still lives here for the non-IBL shade modes; the PBR mode reads only the key,
 * the SH irradiance, and the dials.
