// THE FOOT SWINGS UNDER A LIFTED KNEE. Its hang was the ankle's offset from the knee AS THE
// DRAG FOUND IT — under it for a standing leg, and BEHIND it for a kneeling one, whose shin
// lies on the floor: a knee drawn up out of a kneel took its foot up behind it, trailing at
// knee height, where a half kneel wants the shin vertical and the foot planted under the
// knee. IK_JS_KNEE_HANG_AS_FOUND restores the found offset.
// The hang SWINGS ALONG THE FLOOR, at the shin's length (2026-09-22): the target is where a
// full-length shin from the knee's goal meets the ankle's floor height — behind the knee by
// sqrt(shin^2 - height^2), in the direction the drag found the ankle, and straight under it
// once the knee is a shin's length up. The swing was a LERP between the found offset and the
// vertical one (kKneeUnderLift), two 33cm vectors 100 degrees apart whose midpoint is 21cm
// long: mid-swing the ankle's spring (1e4-1e5 through the release) asked the ankle CLOSER
// to the knee than the shin is long, and the one answer is to FOLD the knee. Every rig
// folded (the base rig's knee flexion rose 103 -> 122 degrees and recovered as its foot
// slid out flat); a half-size character's ran to its 155-degree limit with the ankle and
// toes jammed at theirs, the leg twisted 33 degrees to get the folded foot's toes level, and
// the foot flipped up over the knee (the thigh at its 85-degree abduction limit at the end,
// a gimbal-lock trap: the foot 55cm up in the half kneel). A standing leg's shin is vertical
// and its knee a shin's length up: bit-for-bit what it was. (The lerp is gone.)
