/**
 * @file textureuploadcache.h
 * @brief Per-model dedup of texture uploads: one VulkanTexture per unique decoded image.
 *
 * Figure zones commonly sample the same atlas files (face/lips/ears share the face maps; torso,
 * arms and legs the body maps), and the decode layer already hands every referencing mesh the
 * SAME shared DecodedImage. This cache keys the GPU upload on that image's identity so a shared
 * image is uploaded ONCE per model — one staging copy + mip chain instead of one per zone, which
 * multiplied import time and GPU memory by the sharing factor. It is keyed separately per colour
 * space: the same image could in principle feed both an sRGB slot and a LINEAR slot, which need
 * distinct VkImages. The cache lives only for the duration of a Model's constructor; the meshes
 * keep the textures alive through their shared_ptrs afterwards. Qt-free.
