/**
 * @file scene.h
 * @brief Owns the scene's shared GPU plumbing (ScenePipelines), its passes (shadow, outline,
 *        line overlay), the lighting environment, and the list of imported models. The mesh
 *        analogue of Grid.
 *
 * Kept self-contained so VulkanRenderer doesn't accumulate per-feature pipeline/descriptor code:
 * the renderer just constructs a Scene, forwards imports to addModel(), and calls the three
 * record entry points in order each frame — recordShadowPass() and recordOutlinePass() before
 * the main render pass, record() inside it (before the transparent grid). The posing API is a
 * set of thin forwarders to the ACTIVE figure (sceneposing.cpp); the heavy lifting lives in
 * Model/Armature. Qt-free (Vulkan + std + GLM).
