/**
 * @file model.h
 * @brief One imported model (OBJ mesh or rigged figure): its meshes under a shared transform,
 *        the armature that poses it, and the per-frame GPU pose data the shaders skin with.
 *
 * A Model groups the meshes of one imported file (one Mesh per material group — mesh.h), owns
 * the descriptor pool their set-1 descriptors and its own per-frame set-2 (pose) descriptors
 * come from, and carries an Armature (armature.h) — the runtime skeleton, pose, pins, and
 * full-body IK of a skinned figure — whose skinning dual quaternions it uploads per frame in
 * flight, next to the pose correctives' weights (CorrectiveSet) and the ground samples the
 * ground button scans (GroundSampler). Every posing call here is a thin forwarder into the
 * armature (the ones that change the pose also refresh this model's correctives, which the
 * armature can't know about); new posing behaviour belongs in the armature, never here — the
 * split is what lets the IK harness drive the real drag loop without Vulkan. Qt-free.
