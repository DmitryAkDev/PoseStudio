/**
 * @file ikrig.h
 * @brief The full-body-IK RIG: everything about an IK drag that is POLICY rather than solving —
 *        what is planted and where its pin sits, which joint a grab really drives, when a foot
 *        steps, when the figure lifts off and lands, which joints come down onto the floor, the
 *        body's mass model and support polygon, and the self-collision volumes.
 *
 * Built once per figure from its bind skeleton (the body tree rooted at the PELVIS — rootNode(),
 * the first multi-child descendant of the anatomical root; real figures root at an origin-level
 * figure node whose chain of virtual ancestors is excluded from the rig wholesale: no graph
 * edge, no contact eligibility, no balance mass — the segment masses, the floor clearances, the
 * mesh-fitted body volumes).
 *
 * Per drag: beginDrag() detects which joints are planted on the ground (minus contacts within a
 * limb's length of the effector, by tree path — dragging a foot must lift the foot AND its whole
 * toe subtree), pins each limb's most proximal planted contact at its ground-healed height with
 * a reach LEASH, promotes a token-mass grab (a finger, a toe, a face bone) to the limb's real
 * end joint, and builds the support polygon over all contacts. Each tick the Armature's solve
 * (scene/armatureiksolve.cpp, on scene/ik/jointsolver.h) reads pins(), activeNodes(), the
 * masses, the hull and the volumes, and the rig's per-tick policy runs around it:
 * updateIntent() (down / up intent, the live pins' bounds, the lift-off test) before the solve,
 * updateContacts() (live contacts, the heel-lift intent's pin heights, landings) and
 * updateStepPolicy() (balance- and anchor-driven foot re-planting) after it, all on the solved
 * pose. Positions in/out are model space. Qt-free (std + GLM).
 *
 * The implementation is split across five translation units by phase: ikrig.cpp (build, the
 * body volumes, the shared metric helpers), ikrigdrag.cpp (beginDrag / plantContacts),
 * ikrigpolicy.cpp (the per-tick intents, the lift-off test, the step policy's entry),
 * ikrigstepping.cpp (the stepper) and ikrigcontacts.cpp (live contacts, landings, pin-set
 * maintenance); their shared tuning constants live in the private ikrig_constants.h.
