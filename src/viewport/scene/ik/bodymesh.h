/**
 * @file bodymesh.h
 * @brief A figure's BODY MESH SAMPLE for the self-collision volumes: the skinned mesh's bind
 *        positions with the bone each vertex mostly follows. The Model hands it to the Armature
 *        at import; the rig fits its body volumes to it (IkRig::buildBodyVolumes) instead of
 *        sizing them from the skeleton alone — the chest's depth, the thighs' taper, the
 *        shoulders' width are in the mesh, not in the joint spacing. Qt-free, Vulkan-free; the
 *        skeleton dump writes it as a sidecar so the IK harness fits the same volumes.
