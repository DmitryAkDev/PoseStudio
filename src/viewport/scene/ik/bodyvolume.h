 * @brief The self-collision BODY VOLUMES: tapered capsules between joints (the torso's sections,
 *        the head, the thighs, shins, upper arms and forearms), with the per-node record of which
 *        joints, limb segments and finger riders each one keeps out, and the ONE reading of a
 *        capsule's axis in a pose that every test shares.
 *
 * Built and fitted to the figure's mesh by IkRig::buildBodyVolumes; read by the Armature's solve
 * (one-sided rows), the drag-target clamp, the FK collision stop and the harness. Qt-free (GLM).
