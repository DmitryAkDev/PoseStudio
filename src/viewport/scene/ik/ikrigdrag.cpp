/**
 * @file ikrigdrag.cpp
 * @brief IkRig::beginDrag — everything decided ONCE at the start of an interactive drag: the
 *        token-limb promotion, the planted-contact pins with their ground-healed targets and
 *        socket leashes, the user's hard pins, the support polygon and stepping footprints, the
 *        active subgraph, the soft pose prior with its per-node stiffness model, and the trunk
 *        chain.
 *
 * Pin targets and the pose prior are captured here and never re-read from the pose during the
 * drag: re-reading each tick let the per-tick extraction residual relocate the stance and ratchet
 * the figure across the floor. The order of the decisions matters and is documented inline — in
 * particular the effector is PROMOTED (a finger grab drives the hand, an eye grab the head) before
 * anything that classifies the gesture reads it. See ikrig.cpp for the TU layout; the constants
 * come from ikrig_constants.h. Qt-free (std + GLM).
