 * Every value here was set by a measured failure in the IK harness (tools/ikharness) and the

// feet planted (~1m away — the crouch). (A KNEE drag no longer frees the foot below it, half a
// metre away: see IkRig::liftedByDrag.)
// METRIC, not hop-count: hop rules break both ways on real rigs — the trunk packs tiny 2cm
// bones (a thigh is only 2 hops from the hip), while a foot's small-toe tip segments are 3-4

// 24mm under a pin that holds to microns on every other figure (found by the character sweep).
// On ordinary proportions a hand under its elbow is 0.37 of the limb and a foot under its knee

// position: the drag-start stance shape re-centered on the current CoM. Only standing feet
// step (a pin whose target sits at its bind height, i.e. ground-healed), only with at least
// two of them (stepping the single support would be a fall), and only for a re-plant of at

// chest drag leaned the hip 19cm on planted feet without ever stepping — a person would have
// stepped long before. The balance-EFFORT path is the principled trigger for that lean (the
// pelvis correction fights the imposed lean every tick), and 0.025 restored the steps while
