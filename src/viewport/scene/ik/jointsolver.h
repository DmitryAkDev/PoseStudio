 * @file jointsolver.h
 * @brief Whole-body JOINT-SPACE inverse kinematics: the pose is solved directly in the engine's
 *        own representation — the per-joint Euler channels plus the solve root's translation —
 *        as one regularized nonlinear least-squares problem, converged every tick.
 *
 * Why it exists. The position-space solver (fabriksolver.h) places joint POSITIONS, and the
 * Armature then has to turn those back into Euler channels (the rotation extraction), where the
 * authored limits, the unwitnessed twist and the capped fits all leave residuals; because that
 * loop is iterative, redundant and ill-posed, its per-tick output is kept calm by DAMPING
 * (under-relaxation, movement caps, a settle-freeze, a cursor filter), and damping is lag. The
 * two complaints — tremble and lag — are the two ends of that one trade-off.
 *
 * Here there is no trade-off to make, because the problem is WELL-POSED:
 *
 *   minimize   sum_tasks  w_t * |task_t(theta)|^2          (the cursor, the pins, balance)
 *            + sum_dofs   s_i * (theta_i - reference_i)^2   (the posture term)
 *   subject to the authored per-channel limits (a box).
 *
 * The posture term — every channel pulled toward the drag-start pose with a per-channel
 * stiffness — makes the minimizer UNIQUE, so the pose is a (locally) continuous FUNCTION of the
 * targets: a still cursor gives the same pose every tick (nothing to tremble, no freeze to
 * need), a cursor that returns brings the body back, and pixel noise passes through about 1:1
 * instead of being amplified by an iteration that never settles. And since each tick is solved
 * to convergence from the previous tick's pose (a warm start a few Gauss-Newton steps away),
 * the result is applied in FULL: no relaxation, no caps, no lag. The limits are exact because
 * the unknowns ARE the limited channels; there is no extraction.
 *
 * Method: Levenberg-Marquardt on the weighted residuals with an analytic Jacobian (a channel's
 * world axis crossed with the lever to the task point), solved in the DUAL form — the posture
 * term is diagonal and positive, so each step costs one (rows x rows) Cholesky, a few dozen
 * rows, not a (dofs x dofs) one — with the box handled as an active set (a channel at its limit
 * whose step points outward is frozen for that step) and a projected, cost-checked step. The
 * effector row is HUBER-weighted: past a few centimetres of miss its pull stops growing, so an
 * unreachable cursor stretches the body as far as it goes without buying pin slip or posture
 * distortion in proportion to the cursor's distance.
 *
 * All math in double (hard rows weigh 1e7 against posture terms of order one). Qt-free
 * (std + GLM).
