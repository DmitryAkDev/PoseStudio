/**
 * @file ikrig.cpp
 * @brief IkRig construction: the per-figure FBIK policy state built once from the bind skeleton
 *        (the body tree, the masses, the floor clearances, the mesh-fitted body volumes), plus
 *        the metric helpers every drag phase shares (path lengths, socket leashes, limb
 *        junctions) and the volume queries (the drag-start mask, the drag-target clamp).
 *
 * The rig's implementation spans five translation units so the phases can evolve independently:
 * this file, ikrigdrag.cpp (beginDrag / plantContacts — contacts, pins, user pins, promotion),
 * ikrigpolicy.cpp (the per-tick intents, the lift-off test, the step policy's entry),
 * ikrigstepping.cpp (balance- and anchor-driven foot re-planting) and ikrigcontacts.cpp (live
 * contact re-detection, landings, pin-set maintenance); the tuning constants they share live in
 * ikrig_constants.h. build() hosts the load-bearing rooting decision: the FBIK root is the
 * first multi-child DESCENDANT of the anatomical root (real figures root at an origin-level
 * figure node whose chain is excluded from the rig wholesale — no graph edge, no contact
 * eligibility, no balance mass), and every world-space threshold scales with the figure's
 * pelvis height (sizeScale). Qt-free (std + GLM).

// reclining figure's arms, 70cm in one tick, when her hands touched the floor).

// thigh hangs down (the knee is there), the back of a thigh's thickness when she sits, and the
// pelvis rests on what is under IT. (Two fits by directions were tried first, the same day: the

// cones over the joint's own AND its parent's skin, read in the child's frame: wrong the moment
// the joint bends, it held a sit 6cm in the air.) Kept per bone are the skin's EXTREME points
// only, along 128 directions spread over the sphere (the hull's support to a percent); the rig is
// handed the bones' rotations before a drag and at the top of every tick (setBoneRotations), so a
