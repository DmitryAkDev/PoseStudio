/**
 * @file skeletongraph.h
 * @brief The FBIK body graph: the figure's BODY joints (the figure-node chain above the pelvis
 *        excluded) as a graph rooted at the pelvis, whose one job today is marking the ACTIVE
 *        subgraph of a drag — the paths joining the effector and every pin to the root
 *        (markActivePaths): what the solve may move; everything else rides.
 *
 * setRoot(node) rebuilds the directed parent/children view and the BFS traversal order without
 * touching the engine's anatomical hierarchy. The rig always roots it at the PELVIS. (It is
 * re-rootable because the first, position-space solver once walked it from a ground contact;
 * the capability is kept, unused.)
 * Qt-free (std only + no GLM needed — pure topology).
