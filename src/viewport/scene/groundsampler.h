/**
 * @file groundsampler.h
 * @brief A compact CPU copy of a skinned model's vertices, for finding the CURRENT pose's lowest
 *        point (the ground button / the animated ground drop) — and, since 2026-09-26, the
 *        SURFACE a click is on (pickSurface: the opaque meshes' triangles ride along).
 *
 * The GPU vertex buffers are device-local and unreadable, and a posed figure's lowest point is
 * not its bind box's: a knee bend lifts the feet, so grounding by the bind AABB would sink or
 * float the figure. So every render vertex's skinning inputs (position + joints + weights,
 * ~44 bytes/vertex, ~10 MB for a figure) are kept here and CPU-skinned on demand with the
 * armature's live pose. Static models need no samples: their bind AABB through the transform is
 * exact, and lowestY() handles that case from the bounds alone. Qt-free, Vulkan-free.
