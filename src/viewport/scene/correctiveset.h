/**
 * @file correctiveset.h
 * @brief A model's pose correctives (joint-driven corrective morphs, JCMs) as the GPU blends
 *        them: the resolved driver formulas, the static per-vertex delta table, and the per-frame
 *        weight buffers.
 *
 * Correctives fix the mesh crumpling ("candy-wrapper") at deep elbow/knee/shoulder/hip bends.
 * Each one is a sparse displacement field over the base cage plus a driver formula in joint-angle
 * terms. They are blended ON THE GPU, live: at construction every corrective's base-vertex deltas
 * are mapped through each mesh's baseVertex array onto the render vertices (a seam vertex feeds
 * several) into ONE static device-local delta table per model (set 2 binding 2), and each touched
 * vertex carries its packed run (Vertex::correctiveRange, stamped into the upload copy). The
 * per-frame WEIGHTS ride a host-mapped storage buffer PER FRAME IN FLIGHT (set 2 binding 1, the
 * joint-buffer scheme) — re-evaluated at record time whenever the pose moved (Armature::skinVersion)
 * and copied into the current frame slot when it is behind the weight version. A weight change
 * costs a few hundred bytes per frame, never a geometry re-upload, so the correctives track a drag
 * continuously. (This replaced a CPU re-morph that could only afford to run once a drag ENDED —
 * the figure visibly deformed uncorrected through every drag and snapped right at mouse-up.)
 * A model without correctives keeps 16-byte zero placeholders bound so its set 2 stays complete.
 * Qt-free (Vulkan + std + GLM).
