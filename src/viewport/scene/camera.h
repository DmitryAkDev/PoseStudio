/**
 * @file camera.h
 * @brief A simple orbit camera: yaw/pitch/distance around a target point.
 *
 * Pure math — no Vulkan, no Qt — so it lives in scene/ rather than rendering/ and can
 * be unit-tested in isolation. The renderer asks it for a view-projection matrix each
 * frame; input handling (drag to orbit, wheel to dolly) calls the orbit/dolly/pan
 * mutators. The projection is built for Vulkan's clip space: depth in [0, 1] and the
 * Y axis flipped (see CMake's GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE plus the explicit Y negation).
