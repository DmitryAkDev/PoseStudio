/**

 * @brief The solve's first stages — what the drag IS and which channels answer it (see
 *        armatureiksolve.cpp for the map): the unknowns, the trunk's policy for the tick, the
 *        stiffness classes, and the foot / knee / elbow drag geometry. Also ensureHandMaps, the
 *        per-rig structural map of the hands (found once, read by the rows and the post-steps).
 *
 * Every stage is a member function over the tick's IkSolveScratch (armatureiksolvestate.h) and
 * begins by naming the members it reads and writes. Qt-free (std + GLM).
