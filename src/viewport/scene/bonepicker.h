/**
 * @file bonepicker.h
 * @brief Screen-space joint picking across every figure in the scene — THE FALLBACK since
 *        2026-09-26: Scene::selectBoneAt casts the click against the posed skin first
 *        (Model::pickSurface) and comes here only when the ray misses every figure's surface, a
 *        click just outside the silhouette, and then checks that nothing hides what this found.
 *
 * A click on the viewport is resolved to (figure, bone) here, by projecting each figure's joints
 * with the camera and hit-testing the click against joint ORIGINS and bone BODIES (the segment
 * from a joint to each child joint). Picking is deliberately independent of what the overlay
 * draws: the skeleton is hidden by default and joints are grabbed directly on the figure, so the
 * picker never consults the overlay's visibility. Pure GLM + the models' world joint positions —
 * no Vulkan, no Qt — and free of Scene state, so the selection/active-figure bookkeeping stays in
 * Scene::selectBoneAt while the geometry lives here.

/// a thigh grabs the thigh, where joint-origin picking alone (the thigh's joints sit at the hip
/// and the knee, farther than any sane radius from a mid-thigh click) fell through to a plain
/// model click. A click right ON a joint (kJointSnapPx) still snaps to that joint, so the knee
/// picks the shin bone whose origin it is rather than the thigh segment ending there. A root's
/// own segment is skipped: a figure node sits at the origin with the hip a metre above, and that
/// virtual bone runs straight between the legs. Priority: a joint under the cursor, then the
/// nearest bone body within the click tolerance, then a joint within it (leaf bones — toes,
/// fingertips — have no segment). A miss returns {-1, -1}.
