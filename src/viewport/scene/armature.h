/**
 * @file armature.h
 * @brief The runtime skeleton of a posable figure: its bones, the per-joint pose (Euler rotation
 *        + translation), forward kinematics into skinning dual quaternions, the user's joint
 *        pins, and the full-body-IK integration (armatureik.cpp: the drag lifecycle;
 *        armatureiksolve.cpp: the per-tick whole-body solve on scene/ik/jointsolver.h).
 *
 * An Armature is everything about a figure's pose that is NOT geometry: Model owns one next to
 * its meshes and GPU buffers, uploads the dual quaternions it computes, and forwards every posing
 * call to it. The split is load-bearing: the armature is pure std + GLM — no Vulkan, no Qt — so
 * the IK harness (tools/ikharness/) drives the REAL drag loop on a real figure's dumped
 * skeleton, tick for tick as the viewport does, instead of a mirror copy that drifts. Anything
 * that changes how a pose is composed, clamped, or solved
 * belongs here, never in Model. A static model (an OBJ) still carries an Armature: empty of
 * bones, it holds the model transform and one identity joint for the shared skinned pipeline.
