/**
 * @file armatureiksolvestate.h
 * @brief The scratch state one tick of Armature::solveIk builds up and hands from stage to stage
 *        (armatureiksolve.cpp): what the drag IS, the unknowns and their prices, the rows, the
 *        solve's result. One instance lives for one call of solveIk; every stage is a member
 *        function over it, and the members are listed in the order the stages set them.
 *
 * A member is here because more than one stage reads it; a stage's own working values stay its
 * locals. A stage begins by naming the members it uses (`float& plant = s.plant;`), so its body
 * reads as it did when the solve was one function, and the compiler flags any it forgot. Private
 * to the solve: only armatureiksolve*.cpp include it. Qt-free (std + GLM).
