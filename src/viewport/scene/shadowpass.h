/**
 * @file shadowpass.h
 * @brief The key light's depth-only shadow pass: the shadow map, its skinned depth pipeline, and
 *        the per-frame light frustum fit.
 *
 * Every frame, before the main scene pass, the key light's view of the scene is rendered into a
 * depth map (ShadowMap) through an orthographic frustum fitted around the casters AND the spots
 * where their shadows land on the floor — the ground shadow is only correct where the RECEIVER
 * is inside the frustum, so the floor patch must be covered too. The fitted light matrix is the
 * pass's other product: the Scene writes it into the camera UBO (mesh.frag's self-shadow lookup)
 * and hands it to the grid (the PCSS ground shadow). Owning the map, the pipeline, and the matrix
 * together keeps the Scene down to "fit, then record" and lets the shadow map be created before
 * the scene-wide descriptor set that samples it is written. Qt-free (Vulkan + std + GLM).
