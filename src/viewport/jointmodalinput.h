/**
 * @file jointmodalinput.h
 * @brief The joint mouse mode's input, wherever in the application it lands.
 *
 * The mode (B / S / T: VulkanWindow::toggleJointModal) is MODAL: while it is on, the mouse turns a
 * joint and a click or a key ends it. The viewport sees only the input that arrives at its own
 * native window — so begun with the pointer over a side panel (the user had just scrubbed a dial
 * there), the mode was on and nothing turned until the pointer came back over the viewport, a
 * click on the panel went to the panel, and Esc went to whichever widget had the focus.
 *
 * This is an application-wide event filter that is installed only while the mode is on. It reads
 * the events as they arrive at a WINDOW (the main window, the floating strip: before any widget
 * is handed its copy) and gives the mode's share to the viewport: every mouse move turns the
 * joint, a left click or Enter keeps the result, a right click or Esc puts the joint back — and
 * the click is the mode's alone: it never reaches the widget under it. The viewport's own window
 * is left to its own handlers. While the mode is on the pointer is a four-way arrow everywhere
 * in the application (an override cursor).
