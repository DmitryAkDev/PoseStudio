/**
 * @file jointmodebadge.h
 * @brief The viewport strip's "the mouse is turning a joint" badge.
 *
 * Shown under the strip's buttons for as long as a joint's mouse mode is on (B, S or T with a
 * joint selected: VulkanWindow::beginJointModal) — the mouse's meaning is MODAL then (moving it
 * bends, tilts or twists the joint; a click keeps the result, Esc or a right-click drops it), so
 * the mode must be visible. A rotation-arrow glyph and the dial's name as the Transform tab
 * labels it, in the accent colour, on the same surface as the strip's buttons. Painted, not an
 * icon file.
