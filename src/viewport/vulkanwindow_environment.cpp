/**
 * @file vulkanwindow_environment.cpp
 * @brief VulkanWindow's lighting environment: the default HDRI, the off-thread IBL bake, and the
 *        live lighting dials.
 *
 * One of the seven translation units of VulkanWindow — see vulkanwindow.h for the map. This is
 * the only QtConcurrent user in the viewport: decoding + prefiltering a panorama costs hundreds
 * of milliseconds of CPU, so it runs on a worker and the result is uploaded on the GUI thread,
 * guarded by a request id (a slower earlier bake must never clobber a newer pick) and by a catch
 * boundary (a worker exception is rethrown by QFuture::result() INSIDE the finished slot, and an
 * exception escaping a slot is fatal to a Qt app).
