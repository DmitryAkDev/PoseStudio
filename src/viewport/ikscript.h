/**
 * @file ikscript.h
 * @brief IkScript — the state of the scripted in-app posing test (POSESTUDIO_IK_SCRIPT=<file>),
 *        kept out of VulkanWindow's header.
 *
 * Developer tooling, like IkDiagnostics: VulkanWindow owns one through a unique_ptr that is null
 * unless the environment asks for it. The script drives the REAL viewport — the picker at a
 * pixel, the press path, the camera-parallel drag plane, the 60 Hz tick, the solve, the release
 * settle, render and present — with NO desktop input (nothing is injected into the OS: the
 * window's own gesture functions are called with scripted cursor positions), reports what a
 * user would see as numbers, and saves rendered frames as PNGs read back from the GPU
 * (VulkanRenderer::requestCapture), so a covered window captures as well as a visible one.
 * The runner lives in vulkanwindow_script.cpp; tools/ikscripts/README.md is the command reference.
