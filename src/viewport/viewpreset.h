/**
 * @file viewpreset.h
 * @brief The named camera views the viewport's View picker lists and reports.
 *
 * Its own tiny header so the viewport strip (viewportstrip.h) can name the enum without pulling
 * in the Vulkan window's header — the input, IK and undo machinery the strip has no business
 * seeing. The strip and the window agree on exactly this one vocabulary: the window reports the
 * view it is in through VulkanWindow::viewPresetChanged, the strip asks for one through
 * ViewportStrip::viewSelected, and ViewportWidget wires the two.
