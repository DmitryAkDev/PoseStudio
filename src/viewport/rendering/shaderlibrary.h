/**
 * @file shaderlibrary.h
 * @brief Loads the compiled SPIR-V shaders by name from the build's shader directory.
 *
 * The renderer's constructor used to open each *.spv file inline, so the set of shaders the
 * engine needs was spread over a dozen loadSpirv() calls and mirrored by SHADER_SOURCES in
 * CMakeLists.txt. The library owns the reading (a shader is loaded once and cached; a missing
 * file is a clear VulkanError naming the path and the likely cause) and kShaderNames is the one
 * in-code list of what the build must produce — keep it in step with SHADER_SOURCES.
 *
 * Takes a plain std::string directory, not a Qt path: locating the shader folder is the app's
 * concern (VulkanWindow resolves <applicationDirPath>/shaders), the engine core stays Qt-free.
