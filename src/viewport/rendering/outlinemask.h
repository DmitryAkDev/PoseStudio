/**
 * @file outlinemask.h
 * @brief The selection-outline mask: a screen-sized single-channel coverage target the selected
 *        object's silhouette is rendered into, sampled by the composite to draw the outline.
 *
 * The selected model is drawn (skinned, camera-projected, no depth, no materials) into an R8
 * coverage image — multisampled at the context's MSAA count and resolved, so the mask's edge
 * carries the same fractional coverage the scene's anti-aliased silhouette does. The composite
 * pass (composite.frag) dilates that mask by the outline width and paints the theme's selection
 * blue where the dilation exceeds the coverage: outside the object, hugging its silhouette, with
 * the inner edge blending against the object's own anti-aliased fringe. Depth-independent by
 * design — the outline traces the object's whole projected silhouette even where another model
 * occludes it, like the joints, which are pickable through the mesh.
 *
 * Screen-sized, so the renderer resizes it with the swapchain (resize() rebuilds images +
 * framebuffer; the render pass depends only on the format and is kept, so the scene's mask
 * pipeline never rebuilds). At creation and after every resize the sampled image is moved to
 * the read layout, so the composite can always bind it — the mask pass runs only while something
 * is selected, and the composite ignores the (stale) contents when nothing is. Pure Vulkan +
 * std, no Qt.
