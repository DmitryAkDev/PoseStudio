/**
 * @file renderpassbuilder.h
 * @brief Builds the engine's single-subpass render passes (colour / resolve / depth attachments +
 *        external dependencies) and the framebuffers that go with them.
 *
 * Every pass in this engine is one subpass over a short attachment list — the HDR scene target,
 * the outline mask, the bloom/SSS targets, the swapchain composite, the depth-only shadow map —
 * and four of them were typed out as the same 60 lines of VkAttachmentDescription/Reference/
 * SubpassDependency filling. The builder expresses a pass as its attachment list in order
 * (colour, an optional resolve for the colour just added, an optional depth) plus the
 * dependencies, so the attachment order the framebuffer and the clear-value array must follow
 * is visible in one place per target.
 *
 * The dependency helpers encode the engine's two synchronisation contracts, so a fix is a
 * one-place change: sampledTargetDependencies() for a target rendered every frame and sampled
 * by a later pass (with the depth attachment's own writes included when the pass has one — the
 * omission of those was a cross-frame write-after-write hazard on the HDR target's depth), and
 * sampledDepthTargetDependencies() for a depth-only pass whose map the next passes sample.
 *
 * Pure Vulkan + std, no Qt.
