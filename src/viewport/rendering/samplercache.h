/**
 * @file samplercache.h
 * @brief Shared, device-lifetime VkSamplers keyed by their creation parameters.
 *
 * A sampler describes HOW to filter, not WHAT — yet every VulkanTexture used to create its own
 * identical repeat/linear/mipmapped sampler (a figure imports ~40 unique maps, and every further
 * model adds more, against drivers whose maxSamplerAllocationCount is 4000), and four more
 * identical clamp/linear samplers lived in the HDR target, the outline mask, the post chain and
 * the IBL maps. The cache hands out one VkSampler per distinct SamplerDesc, owned by the
 * VulkanContext for the device's lifetime; textures and targets borrow the handle and own only
 * their image + view. Handles returned by get() must never be destroyed by the caller.
 *
 * Mipmapped presets use VK_LOD_CLAMP_NONE rather than the image's own level count: the sampled
 * level is clamped to the VIEW's mip range after the sampler's LOD clamp (Vulkan spec, image
 * level selection), so one sampler serves every mip count with bit-identical results.
 *
 * Pure Vulkan + std, no Qt. Not thread-safe (GUI-thread use only, like the rest of the engine).
