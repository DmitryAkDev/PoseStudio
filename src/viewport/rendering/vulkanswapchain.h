/**
 * @file vulkanswapchain.h
 * @brief Everything tied to the window's current resolution: the swapchain images, their
 *        views, the present render pass, and the per-image framebuffers.
 *
 * This is the layer that gets thrown away and rebuilt on every resize (and whenever the
 * surface goes out of date). VulkanContext stays alive across that; VulkanSwapchain does not.
 * The render pass depends only on the surface's colour format (which doesn't change on
 * resize), so recreate() keeps it and only rebuilds the resolution-dependent images/framebuffers.
 *
 * The pass is deliberately minimal: ONE single-sample colour attachment, loaded DONT_CARE and
 * stored for presentation, no depth. Since the HDR/post rework the scene renders offscreen
 * (HdrTarget, at the context's MSAA count) and the only draw in this pass is the fullscreen
 * composite, which overwrites every pixel with depth testing off — a multisampled colour target
 * + depth buffer here would be cleared and resolved every frame (~236 MB at 5120x1440 4x) for
 * nothing. Pipelines built against this pass (the composite) are therefore single-sample.
