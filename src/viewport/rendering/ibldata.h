/**
 * @file ibldata.h
 * @brief The CPU-baked image-based-lighting products the GPU layer uploads: the prefiltered
 *        specular cubemap and the environment-BRDF LUT.
 *
 * These two PODs are the data contract between the scene-side bakes (scene/environment.h, which
 * computes them) and rendering/iblmaps.h (which uploads them into the mesh pipeline's IBL set).
 * They live here, in rendering/, so the GPU layer never has to include a scene header: rendering/
 * sits BELOW scene/ in the engine's layering (only VulkanRenderer, the frame orchestrator, looks
 * upward). Pure GLM + std, no Vulkan, no Qt.
