/**
 * @file hdrtarget.h
 * @brief The offscreen HDR scene target: MSAA RGBA16F colour + depth, resolved to a sampleable
 *        single-sample HDR texture.
 *
 * The scene (backdrop, meshes, grid, overlays) renders here instead of straight into the
 * swapchain, in LINEAR HDR — the PBR shader no longer tonemaps inline. The resolved texture then
 * feeds the post-processing chain (the screen-space SSS blur, bloom bright-extract, and the
 * fullscreen composite that tonemaps into the swapchain). The pass carries TWO colour
 * attachments — the scene (diffuse in the PBR mode, whose alpha is the SSS mask) and the PBR
 * opaque pass's SPECULAR, kept apart so the SSS blur can never smear glints into a wet film —
 * each with its own single-sample resolve, plus a depth attachment, all at the context's MSAA
 * count; every scene pipeline builds against this pass. It depends only on formats, so
 * resize() rebuilds images + framebuffer but keeps the pass — scene pipelines never rebuild.
 * Pure Vulkan + std, no Qt.
