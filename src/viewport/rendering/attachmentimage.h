/**
 * @file attachmentimage.h
 * @brief RAII owner for a 2D render-target image (+ its view), plus the image-layout barrier
 *        helpers every offscreen target and texture upload needs.
 *
 * Five classes used to carry their own copy of "vmaCreateImage a 2D attachment, then
 * vkCreateImageView it" (the HDR target, the outline mask, the bloom targets, the swapchain's old
 * MSAA/depth targets, the shadow map) and five more copies of "fill a VkImageMemoryBarrier and
 * vkCmdPipelineBarrier it". Centralising them here does three things: the target classes shrink
 * to their render pass + policy; a throwing constructor can no longer leak an image whose view
 * failed (the owner frees both); and one policy line — lazily-allocated memory for TRANSIENT
 * attachments, which is what makes an MSAA colour target memoryless on tile-based GPUs (Apple
 * via MoltenVK) — applies everywhere instead of nowhere.
 *
 * Pure Vulkan + VMA + std, no Qt (the rendering/ rule).
