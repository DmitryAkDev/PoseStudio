/**
 * @file shadowmap.h
 * @brief The key light's shadow map: a depth-only offscreen target + the comparison sampler
 *        the lit shaders test against.
 *
 * Owns the D32 depth image, its single-sample depth-only render pass (independent of the scene
 * pass's MSAA count), the framebuffer, and borrows a comparison (PCF) sampler + a raw-depth
 * twin from the context's SamplerCache. Scene records the depth-only pass into it each frame
 * (recordShadowPass) before the main pass samples it — the mesh shader through set 3 binding 2
 * (shadowing the key light on the figure), the grid shader through the same set (the
 * ground/contact shadow). The sampler clamps to an opaque-white border, so any receiver outside
 * the fitted light frustum simply reads "unshadowed".
 *
 * At creation the image is cleared to 1.0 and moved to the read layout, so frames before the
 * first shadow pass sample a defined, fully-lit map. When Scene SKIPS the pass (no casters, or
 * the shadow dial off) the map is NOT re-cleared — it keeps whatever the last pass wrote; what
 * makes receivers read lit then is the degenerate light matrix Scene::recordShadowPass parks
 * in the camera UBO, which projects every receiver outside the map's depth range.
 *
 * Like the rest of rendering/, pure Vulkan + std — no Qt.
