/**
 * @file postprocess.h
 * @brief The post-processing chain over the HDR scene target: screen-space subsurface
 *        scattering, bloom, and the fullscreen composite that tonemaps into the swapchain.
 *
 * Six fullscreen passes share one fullscreen-triangle vertex shader (fullscreen.vert) and one
 * three-sampler descriptor layout: the SSS blur (two full-resolution masked passes, H into a
 * scratch target and V back INTO the HDR resolve, so everything downstream sees diffused skin —
 * the V pass adds the scene's separately-rendered specular back over the blur), the classic
 * three-pass half-resolution bloom (bright-extract with a soft threshold, then a separable
 * Gaussian: H into a second target, V back into the first), and the composite, which adds the
 * bloom over the HDR image, applies ACES (PBR mode with the tonemap dial on; every other mode
 * passes through untouched, since the stylized modes still author display-ready values) and
 * paints the selection outline. The composite draws through the swapchain's single-sample
 * present pass; the other five share one single-sample RGBA16F "bloom" render pass that is
 * size-agnostic. Resolution-dependent images/descriptors rebuild on resize(); the render pass +
 * pipelines are format-only and stay. Pure Vulkan + std, no Qt.
