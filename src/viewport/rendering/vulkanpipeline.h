/**
 * @file vulkanpipeline.h
 * @brief A single graphics pipeline (+ its layout), built from SPIR-V bytecode.
 *
 * Intentionally takes raw SPIR-V *bytes*, not file paths: locating and reading the
 * compiled .spv files is an application concern (it depends on where the build dropped
 * them), so that lives in ShaderLibrary / VulkanRenderer. This class stays a pure Vulkan
 * object and could be reused outside the app.
 *
 * The fixed-function state every pipeline shares (dynamic viewport/scissor — so pipelines
 * survive resizes untouched) lives in the class; everything that differs between pipelines —
 * push constants, blending, depth, culling, topology, vertex input, descriptor set layouts,
 * sample count, colour-attachment count and write masks — arrives via PipelineConfig. Add a
 * knob there only when a real use case needs it, or introduce a small PipelineBuilder if the
 * permutations grow.

 * @brief The fixed-function knobs that differ between the engine's pipelines.
 *
 * Defaults describe an opaque, depth-tested+written, vertex-buffer-less, single-colour-attachment
 * pipeline at the context's MSAA count with a vertex-only push constant. The engine's pipelines
 * are all variations on that: the grid flips on blending, off depth-write and alpha-write, binds
 * the scene's IBL/shadow set, and declares the HDR pass's second colour attachment (masked); the
 * mesh pipelines supply the interleaved vertex layout, four descriptor set layouts and a
 * vertex+fragment push block, and the opaque one writes the second (specular) attachment; the
 * skeleton overlay is a LINE_LIST; the shadow pass is single-sample and depth-only with a static
 * depth bias; the outline mask and the post passes are depth-free; the post passes and the
 * composite are single-sample. The rest (dynamic viewport/scissor, front face, blend factors) is
 * shared and lives in VulkanPipeline itself.
