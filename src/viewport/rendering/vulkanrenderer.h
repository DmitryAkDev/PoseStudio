/**
 * @file vulkanrenderer.h
 * @brief The frame orchestrator: command buffers, frame synchronisation, the screen-sized
 *        targets, and the acquire -> record -> submit -> present loop that runs the frame graph.
 *
 * This is the one file in rendering/ that sits ABOVE scene/ — it owns the Scene and the Grid and
 * is allowed to include their headers; every other rendering/ file stays below the scene layer.
 * Owns the swapchain and everything that depends on the surface (the offscreen HDR target, the
 * outline mask, the post chain), drives one frame per drawFrame() call, and transparently
 * rebuilds those when the window resizes or the surface goes out of date.
 *
 * A frame (recordCommandBuffer) is a fixed sequence of passes: the key-light SHADOW map -> the
 * selection OUTLINE mask (only with a selection) -> the offscreen HDR SCENE pass at the context's
 * MSAA count (backdrop, meshes, grid, overlays, resolved to a sampleable RGBA16F image plus a
 * separate specular image) -> the screen-space SSS blur and BLOOM (PBR mode only) -> the
 * single-sample swapchain pass, whose sole draw is the fullscreen COMPOSITE (tonemap + bloom +
 * outline). Sync is per frame-in-flight (kMaxFramesInFlight) for the acquire semaphore and
 * fence, per swapchain image for the render-finished semaphore.
 *
 * Like the rest of rendering/, this is intentionally Qt-free — it takes a plain
 * std::string shader directory — so the only Qt coupling in the whole viewport lives in
 * VulkanWindow / ViewportWidget.
