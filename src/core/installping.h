/**
 * @file installping.h
 * @brief Declares InstallPing, the anonymous "this install exists" beacon sent on every launch.
 *
 * PoseStudio counts active installations and their versions by sending one small, signed POST
 * per launch to the project's ping endpoint. It is deliberately minimal and fully disclosed:
 *
 *   - It sends a random install ID (a UUID generated on first use and kept in Preferences), the
 *     app version, the operating system name and version, the CPU architecture, whether the app
 *     was installed or is running portable, the Qt version, and a timestamp. No names, no paths,
 *     no hardware IDs, no usage data — see buildPayload() for the exact set.
 *   - It never blocks or delays anything: it fires from a timer a few seconds after the main
 *     window shows, carries a transfer timeout, ignores every failure, and never retries in the
 *     same session. One ping per launch, no daily cap: the server keys on the install ID, so
 *     repeat launches can't inflate the install count.
 *   - Users can switch it off in Preferences → General (PREF_PING_ENABLED, default on).
 *
 * Anti-spoofing: the request body is signed with HMAC-SHA256 (X-PoseStudio-Signature) under a
 * key compiled in from the POSESTUDIO_PING_KEY build definition. The key is NOT in the
 * repository — official release builds receive it from a GitHub Actions secret; any other build
 * has an empty key and never pings at all (the server rejects unsigned pings, so there is nothing
 * to gain by sending them). A key inside a shipped binary is extractable in principle, so it is
 * only the first layer: the server also counts distinct install IDs rather than requests,
 * validates every field, and rate-limits new IDs per address.
 *
 * The key is the ONE lever: a build configured with -DPOSESTUDIO_PING_KEY=... pings, Debug or
 * Release, and a build without one never does. (An earlier cut also required an endpoint
 * override in Debug builds; the second gate only confused local testing and was dropped.)
 *
 * Developer levers:
 *   - POSESTUDIO_NO_PING=1 in the environment disables the ping for that run.
 *   - POSESTUDIO_PING_URL=<url> overrides the endpoint (a local listener, a staging server).
