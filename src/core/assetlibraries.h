/**
 * @file assetlibraries.h
 * @brief The one place that reads and writes the AssetLibraries table.
 *
 * An asset library is a physical folder the Asset Manager browses. The table holds each
 * registered folder plus two flags: AssetLibraryIsBuiltIn (the single "Maquettes" library that
 * ships with the app — always sorted first, never user-removable) and AssetLibraryEnabled
 * (reserved for a future disable toggle; every reader filters on it so a disabled row would
 * simply vanish from the UI).
 *
 * Before this header existed the same SELECT/INSERT/DELETE statements were typed out in the
 * Asset Manager, the Preferences → Assets page, LibraryPaths and the database bootstrap, each
 * with its own ordering and error handling. Route every library query through here so the
 * display order (built-in first, then user libraries by folder NAME, case-insensitive — not by
 * full path, which misorders libraries living under different parents/drives) and the
 * duplicate-add semantics are defined exactly once.
 *
 * Requires the application database to be open (main.cpp opens it before any widget exists).
 * GUI thread only, like the rest of the data layer.
