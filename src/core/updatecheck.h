/**
 * @file updatecheck.h
 * @brief Declares UpdateCheck, the "is a newer PoseStudio out?" check against GitHub Releases.
 *
 * Once per launch, a few seconds after the main window shows, the app asks GitHub for the
 * project's latest release and, when its version is newer than the running one, shows a message
 * with a link to that release page. It is deliberately minimal and fully disclosed:
 *
 *   - One GET of the public releases/latest endpoint — no token, no account. Nothing about the
 *     user travels beyond the request itself and a "PoseStudio/<version>" user agent (GitHub
 *     requires one). Pre-releases and drafts are never offered: that endpoint excludes them.
 *   - It never blocks or delays anything: a timer arms it after the window is up, the request
 *     carries a transfer timeout, every failure is logged at debug level and ignored, and it
 *     never retries in the same session.
 *   - The user can switch the startup check off in Preferences → General
 *     (PREF_UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED, default on) and can silence one particular version ("Skip This
 *     Version" in the prompt, PREF_UPDATE_SKIPPED_VERSION). Help → "Check for Updates…" runs the
 *     same check on demand and reports the outcome either way (up to date / newer / failed),
 *     ignoring a skipped version.
 *
 * Developer levers:
 *   - POSESTUDIO_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 in the environment disables the startup check for that run.
 *   - POSESTUDIO_UPDATE_URL=<url> overrides the endpoint — point it at a local server that
 *     returns {"tag_name":"v9.9.9","html_url":"..."} to see the prompt without a real release.
