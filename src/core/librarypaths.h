/**
 * @file librarypaths.h
 * @brief Resolves per-user content locations rooted in the user's own asset library.
 *
 * The "My PoseStudio Library" folder is the writable, user-visible home for content the user is
 * expected to browse and extend by hand — unlike QStandardPaths::AppDataLocation, which hides
 * internal state (the database). It is an ordinary asset library: registered in the AssetLibraries
 * table and browsable in the Asset Manager. initializeDatabase() creates it in Documents once on a
 * fresh install; a user who already has a library folder by that name (registered from anywhere on
 * disk) keeps theirs, and that one is resolved here. HDRI environment panoramas live in its hdri/
 * subfolder — the folder the Environment panel lists and where users drop their own .hdr files.
 *
 * Cost model: the library root is looked up in the database ONCE and cached (see
 * invalidateCache); every other function is pure path arithmetic or a directory scan, and the
 * one filesystem write (creating hdri/) is explicit — ensureHdriDirectory() — rather than a side
 * effect of every lookup. The panorama scan returns each file's category and display name
 * precomputed, so callers never re-derive them.
