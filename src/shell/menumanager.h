/**
 * @file menumanager.h
 * @brief Declares MenuManager, which builds and owns the application's top menu bar.
 *
 * The menus are the shell's one dependency on the rest of the app: File → Import / pose I/O and
 * every Edit / View action drive the viewport through the ViewportWidget facade, and
 * Preferences (plus the Asset Manager's "Manage Asset Folders") open the PreferencesDialog from
 * one entry point, openPreferencesDialog(), which is also where the dialog's library-change
 * signals are wired back to the live Asset Manager. Both collaborators are registered after
 * setupMenus() (main.cpp builds the menus before the panels exist), so the actions capture
 * `this` and look the widgets up at trigger time rather than binding to them at build time.
