/**
 * @class SplashOverlay
 * @brief Covers its parent window with the PoseStudio branding image until clicked.
 *
 * Tracks the parent's geometry via an event filter so it always fills the window, and
 * deletes itself on the next click anywhere within it.
 *
 * It is a frameless, translucent *top-level window* (not a child widget) deliberately: the
 * 3D viewport is hosted in a native child window (QWidget::createWindowContainer), and native
 * windows are composited on top of ordinary overlay widgets — a child-widget overlay would be
 * hidden behind the viewport. A top-level window *owned by the parent* (the parent pointer plus
 * the Qt::Tool type) is composited above the viewport surface instead.
 * Crucially it is NOT a global always-on-top window (no Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint): because it's
 * an *owned* window, the OS keeps it above PoseStudio's own window/viewport, but it still yields
 * to other applications when they take focus. An always-on-top splash would float over and block
 * every other app — even ones the user switched to — which is a bad experience.
