# In-app posing scripts

Scripted posing tests that run inside the real application — the picker, the press path, the
camera-parallel drag plane, the 60 Hz solve loop, the release settle, the renderer — and save
what the viewport rendered as PNG files. They exist so that a posing change can be *looked at*,
not only measured: the IK harness (`tools/ikharness`) checks numbers on the armature alone,
and a pose can pass every gate and still look wrong.

Nothing is injected into the operating system. The window's own gesture functions are called
with a scripted cursor, so a run does not touch the mouse or keyboard and is safe on a desktop
that is in use; frames are read back from the GPU, so the window does not need to be visible.

## Running

```
POSESTUDIO_IK_SCRIPT=<script.txt> POSESTUDIO_IK_SCRIPT_OUT=<folder> PoseStudio <figure preset>
```

The app imports the figure, runs the script, writes the shots into the output folder and exits
with the number of `expect` lines that failed as its exit code. `run.sh` wraps that and builds a
contact sheet; `run_all.sh` runs every script in this folder as a test suite:

```
POSESTUDIO_TEST_FIGURE=<figure preset> tools/ikscripts/run.sh tools/ikscripts/gallery_side.txt out/side
POSESTUDIO_TEST_FIGURE=<figure preset> POSESTUDIO_IKSHOTS_REF=<reference folder> tools/ikscripts/run_all.sh out
```

`run_all.sh` prints each script's failed expectations and a pass/fail summary (its exit code is
the number of scripts with a failure), and — with `POSESTUDIO_IKSHOTS_REF` — compares every shot
with its reference (`compare.py`): the shots that LOOK different are listed and laid out beside
their references in `<out>/<script>/changes.png`, so after a change there is one image per
script to look at, holding only the poses that moved. `run_all.sh <out> --accept` makes the run's
shots the new references — after you have looked. The references are renders of a figure preset:
keep them outside the repository.

The scripts:

| Script | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `gallery_side.txt` | Trunk gestures from the side: chest and head nudged back, bows, the chest-walk, the hip hinge, a crouch, a hand reach. |
| `gallery_mixed.txt` | Sideways chest pull and hip sway (front), kneel, sit, the pinned seat, a bow with a posed arm. |
| `gallery_limbs.txt` | Hand across the body, elbow, knee raise, foot slide, stride, lunge, foot lifted behind, lifted by the hand. |
| `gallery_perspective.txt` | The Home and three-quarter views a user poses in: hips, chest, head, hand and foot drags where "down" on screen is down and toward the camera. |
| `gallery_floor.txt` | Floor poses from several drags each: toward all fours, a kneel sat back on the heels, a sit reclined by the chest, a sit with a leg stretched out, a sit LAID DOWN on her back and sat up again — with the SKIN's height over the floor, the pelvis's pitch and the worst single-tick move asserted, and the sat-up pose shot from the FRONT as well: a drag in the sagittal plane must leave her symmetric (the pelvis bone's twist and side bend are asserted), and legs folded to one side do not show from the side. |
| `session_poses.txt` | Whole poses built from several drags in a row (a walk, a sit with a hand to the knee, a high reach, picking something up), shot from a three-quarter view. |
| `check_returns.txt` | Numbers only: out-and-home in one drag, a bow undone in a second drag, a walking drag let go of mid-step, a posed head. |
| `gallery_hands.txt` | Hands laid on the body: a hand on the hip, both hands on the hips, on the heart, on top of the head, on the belly, behind the back, seated on the knee, and a hand laid and taken away — with `palm.<bone>` asserted. |
| `gallery_scoped.txt` | Ctrl + drag. On a limb or the head, the SCOPED drag: a hand, a knee and the head each moved with only their own chain, the rest of the body asserted still (`movedxz.<bone>`, `moved.<bone>`). On the body itself, the FIGURE MOVE: the chest lifted and the hips carried with the whole figure going along as posed (no channel turned, the feet travelling with the grab), the Ground button bringing her back down, the floor stopping a push down, and a pinned hand staying where it is pinned while the body moves. |
| `gallery_digits.txt` | Fingers, toes and the face, in close-up: a fingertip curled, a finger pulled far beyond its reach, the thumb, a Ctrl-drag of a finger, a toe raised — each with the hand, the foot and the body asserted still (`moved.<bone>` under 0.01mm) — the back of the hand still dragging the arm, and clicks on the eye, the jaw and an ear each selecting the head (`selected.head`), a drag from the face moving the head with the face's bones untouched. |
| `gallery_landing.txt` | The Ground button's landing bounce: a figure lifted and dropped 5cm, 50cm and 2m, shot falling, at the deepest of the dip and after — the knees' fold asserted deeper for the higher drop, the pose afterwards asserted exactly the pose she was dropped in, the skin on the floor — a posed figure keeping her pose through it, and a kneeling one landing with no bounce. |
| `check_picking.txt` | Numbers only: what a click selects (`selected.<bone>`) — hidden parts are never selected through the part in front, a click on a joint's own pixel takes that joint (the hip's, though its skin is the pelvis bone's). |

Useful beside it: `QT_LOGGING_TO_CONSOLE=1` (the `[ikscript]` lines reach a redirected stderr),
`POSESTUDIO_NO_PING=1`, `POSESTUDIO_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`, and any `IK_…` probe for an A/B
(`run.sh` passes extra `NAME=value` arguments through as environment). For a pop only a scripted
click makes: `POSESTUDIO_IK_SCRIPT_TICKS=1` prints the worst joint's move every tick with the grab
and the cursor, `POSESTUDIO_IK_SCRIPT_EULERS="lThigh,lShin"` those bones' channels every tick,
`POSESTUDIO_PICK_TRACE=1` what the click's surface cast counted and hit, and `IK_DRAG_STATE_TRACE=1`
the pins planted at each press and, per tick, the cursor, the grab offset and the target the rig
was handed (`[drag-map]`).
`montage.py` needs Python with Pillow.

## Commands

One command per line; `#` starts a comment. Bones are named as the reference figure names them
(`hip`, `chest`, `head`, `lHand` …); the runner maps them onto the other generations' names, so the
same script runs on any figure — set `POSESTUDIO_TEST_FIGURE` to another preset and look. `<bone>@<share>` means the point that share of the way
along the bone's limb segment — the flesh, where a user clicks — instead of the joint.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `view front\|back\|left\|right\|top\|bottom\|home` | The view keys. In `right` the camera looks from +X: screen-right is the figure's back. |
| `orbit <yaw°> <pitch°>` | An orbit drag, in degrees (back to perspective, like one). |
| `frame` | Frame the selection. |
| `closeup <bone> <radius m>` | Frame the camera on that joint, the given radius filling the view — a hand, a foot, the face, before posing a finger. |
| `shade <row>` | Shade mode, a row of the picker. |
| `pose <file>` / `reset` / `undo` / `ground` | Load a pose file, Reset Pose, Undo, the Ground button. |
| `lift <metres>` | Raise the active figure that far off the floor, as posed; `ground` then drops her. The fall and the landing bounce run on the app's own timer: `wait` through them (half a metre falls in 19 ticks, the bounce lasts 21-30). |
| `fk <bone> <dx°> <dy°> <dz°>` | Turn a joint, as the X/Y/Z wheel would (through the FK collision stop). |
| `pin <bone>[@share]` / `unpinall` | Click there and press P; drop every pin. Like `press`, when the pick lands on another part of the body (the hanging hand covers the hip from the side) the named bone is pinned instead, and the log says `pinned by name instead`. |
| `click <bone>[@share]` | The real pick at that pixel; prints what it found. The pixel is the NAMED bone's joint's, whatever a selection of it selects: `click lEye` clicks at the eye, and finds the head. |
| `pick2d on\|off` | The A/B: the 2D pick alone, as before 2026-09-26 (every joint and bone body projected to the screen, the nearest within 32px taken, no occlusion check) — a hidden part CAN be selected through another. `POSESTUDIO_PICK_2D=1` does the same for a whole run. |
| `press <bone>[@share]` | The real press: the pick at the bone's pixel, then the press path (an IK drag begins). The pick is honest — what it finds is what is under that pixel — and on another body that can be another limb (a broad character's hanging arm covers her chest from the side, one hand covers the other). When the rig would then drag a different joint than the one named, the bone is grabbed by name at the same point instead, and the log says `the pick found <other> there`. A small bone OF the named one (a pectoral for the chest) is what a user's click finds too, and stands. |
| `cpress <bone>[@share]` | The Ctrl press: the same pick and press path, beginning the Ctrl + drag — a SCOPED drag for a limb or the head (the grabbed chain alone moves), the FIGURE MOVE for the body itself (the hips, the abdomen, the chest: the whole figure as posed, nothing planted, the user's pins holding), the digit's own drag for a finger or a toe. |
| `drag <dxPx> <dyPx> <moveTicks> <holdTicks>` | Move the cursor in screen pixels (+y down), then hold. |
| `dragv <right m> <up m> <moveTicks> <holdTicks>` | The same, given in metres along the view's right/up axes at the grab's depth. |
| `dragw <dx> <dy> <dz> <moveTicks> <holdTicks>` | Move the cursor's *world* target (the harness's gestures, for parity). |
| `wheel <notches>` | Depth notches during a drag. |
| `release` | Mouse-up; waits for the settle. Prints a report first. |
| `wait <ticks>` | 60 Hz ticks. |
| `report [label]` | Gaze, lowest joint, grab-to-cursor, hips/head travel since the press, pelvis angles, steps, worst single-tick joint move, and the posed channels. |
| `expect <metric> <op> <value>` | A test assertion (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`). A failure is printed and counted; the app's exit code is the count. |
| `shot <name>` | Save the next rendered frame as `<name>.png`. |
| `quit` | Exit (also at the end of the script). |

## Metrics (`expect`)

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `grab` / `grabpx` | The grabbed point's distance from the cursor, in mm / on screen in pixels (during a drag). |
| `hips`, `head` | Moved since the last press, mm. |
| `steps` | Steps taken in the drag. |
| `jump` | Worst single-tick move of any joint, mm. |
| `lowest` | The lowest body joint's height over the floor, mm (negative = through it). |
| `meshlow` | The lowest point of the posed SKIN over the floor, mm (negative = flesh through the floor — invisible to every joint reading). |
| `gaze`, `headroll` | The head's look direction over the horizon and its sideways tilt, degrees. |
| `tilt.<bone>` | A bone's tilt from upright, degrees. |
| `y.<bone>`, `moved.<bone>`, `movedxz.<bone>` | A joint's height, its travel since the last press, and that travel along the floor alone (a planted foot's place, a heel lift aside), mm. |
| `selected.<bone>` | 1 if the selected joint is that bone or a bone of its rigid segment (what a `click` picked), else 0. |
| `euler.<bone>.<x\|y\|z>` | A posed channel, degrees. |
| `palm.<bone>.<x\|y\|z>` | A hand's palm normal, that world component (+1/-1): where a hand laid on the body faces. The figures face +z, their right side is -x. |

Expectations are regression guards set from what the app does today, with margin — not
specifications. A gesture given in screen metres is only as exact as its guess at the figure's
proportions: where a gate reads looser than the harness's, the gesture is off the joint's arc.

## What to look for

The runner prints `POP at tick N: <joint> moved X mm in one tick` for every single-tick move over
10cm — never a drag's pace — and `report` names the joint that moved most and when.

A script that does not reach its end (the app went away: a crash, a lost device, a window someone
closed) is reported as DID NOT FINISH, and the app's whole output is kept beside the shots as
`unfinished.txt` with its exit code.


Numbers first (`report`): the grabbed point on the cursor, no unexpected steps, no large
single-tick moves. Then the sheet: balance (is the weight over the feet?), arms and head
(do idle limbs look held or natural?), feet flat, nothing through the floor or the body.
A change that improves a number and makes a sheet look worse is a regression.
