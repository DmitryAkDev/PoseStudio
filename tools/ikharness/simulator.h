/**
 * @file simulator.h
 * @brief The drag-loop simulator: the viewport's IK tick, without the viewport. A Scenario
 *        scripts a cursor path over a grabbed joint (plus optional user pins, an FK pre-pose, a
 *        hover, a figure scale and cursor noise); runScenario drives the REAL Armature loop
 *        (beginIkDrag -> dragIkTo per tick through the shared IkCursorFilter -> the animated
 *        release settle -> endIkDrag) and measures everything the real-skeleton phases gate.
 *
 * Metric semantics worth knowing before gating on them: contactMinY / contactBindMinY are mins
 * over DIFFERENT joints (the lowest contact pin reached vs the lowest contact pin's rest height),
 * so their difference only detects sinking below the LOWEST pin's bind height — exact for two
 * same-height feet, weaker for knee + foot pins; penetrationMax is the per-joint check against
 * the rig's own floor clearance. `suspended` reads "every pin released while contacts existed",
 * which cannot detect a suspension that a user pin survives. runIdleMetrics is a second,
 * identical pass that keeps per-joint step histories for the idle-joint tremble metrics, so the
 * main loop stays a plain mirror of the viewport's tick.
